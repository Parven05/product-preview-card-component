## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

From this i learned how to use flexbox with div. It make me more understand in that CSS flexbox topic even more

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
body {
  background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I think i still struggle with flexbox box and grid properties.So i need to do more scratch works to improve my CSS skills

### Useful resources

- [resource 2](https://www.internetingishard.com) - This is an amazing website which helped me finally understand some CSS properties. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
